      <h1>Problem 3</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>For problem 3, you will need to display the data in a more interactive format.</p>
      <p>Since this is trade data, we want to see the result of our trades. As you've already seen, each trade has a price, symbol, and number of shares purchased. With the assumption that these trades are in chronological order, we want to animate the trades "as they come in," and calculate the amount of money up or down we are.</p>
      <p>A point of order: trades cannot be "shorted." In other words, you cannot sell a stock without having first bought it.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="output-section">
      <section id="net-total-container">
        <!-- Could make this more dynamic while trades are happening -->
        <h4>Net Profit/Loss $<span id="net-total">0</span></h4>
      </section>
      <div id="output-three">
        <!-- OUTPUT SECTION -->
        {{> ../partials/cards }}
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Display</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each trade will come in as a "card." These cards should appear through an animation (animation choice is your own).</li>
        <li>If a trade is profitable, both the card's border and the trade's profit/loss text should be green.</li>
        <li>If a trade loses money, both the card's border and the trade's profit/loss text should be red.</li>
        <li>The net profit/loss amount should turn green when positive, red when negative.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An example of some card states is displayed below:</p>
      <div class="inline-cards">
        <img src="/images/card-green.png" alt="Card example image">
        <img src="/images/card-green-red.png" alt="Card example image">
        <img src="/images/card-red.png" alt="Card example image">
      </div>

      <h2>Functionality</h2>
      <p>You will need to calculate the profit and/or loss of each trade (how much money it made or lost) as well as the net profit/loss of all trades combined.</p>
      <p>Each trade should display:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the action,</li>
        <li>symbol,</li>
        <li>price,</li>
        <li>number of shares,</li>
        <li>profit or loss after the trade,</li>
        <li>and net profit or loss after the trade</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The net Profit/Loss should equal <strong>$175</strong> when completed.</p>
