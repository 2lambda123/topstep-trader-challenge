# TopstepTrader Front End Developer Interview Test

Welcome to the TopstepTrader front end developer test!

This test consists of three problems. For each problem, you'll be given a fresh page with the prompt and an area in the HTML for your output/result.

We've kept the tech pretty simple, using just a few libraries to help make things easier. Our front end is built with [Mustache templates](https://ustache.github.io/) to compose HTML templates, [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling, and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to bring it all together. Our back end is a simple [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server.

That said, feel free to add in any libraries or tools you like to help solve the problems. In fact, you're free to change anything in the codebase you'd like, but we only ask that you solve the problems.

When you're done, push the code to a **private GitHub repository** on your own GitHub account. Be sure to share the repository with John Goode at [jgoode85](https://github.com/jgoode85).

Good luck!
